# ClearTemp
Project that clears your temp files.
-
---
You can launch jar file by double-clicking it, but if you want to use some flags, launch it from command line:

java -jar ClearTemp.jar [-console] [-username:NAME] [-block] [-unblock] [-excex]


- -console = show console
- -username:NAME = clear temp of specific user (replace NAME with user's name) !!THIS ISN'T WORKING ON LINUX!!
- -block = block deleting temp with this program
- -unblock = unblock deleting temp with this program
- -excex = exiting on exception (that is, whenever a program finds a temporary file that cannot be deleted, it stops)


The args in square brackets aren't mandatory, and you also don't need to use both of them.

I am not responsible for any misuse. Use this program only with the permission of the user to whom you are deleting temporary files.


*you can download the jar file [here](https://github.com/ENGO150/ClearTemp/releases).
