# ClearTemp
Project that clears your temp files.
-
Btw this is my first python project, so sorry for the code quality.

Open Main.py to instantly clear you temp files. You can also lunch it from command line:

python Main.py [-console] [-username:NAME] [-block] [-unblock]


- -console = show console
- -username:NAME = clear temp of specific user (replace NAME with user's name)
- -block = block deleting temp with this program
- -unblock = unblock deleting temp with this program


The args in square brackets aren't mandatory, and you also don't need to use both of them.

I am not responsible for any misuse. Use this program only with the permission of the user to whom you are deleting temporary files.
