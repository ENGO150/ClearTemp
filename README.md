Project that clears your temp files.

Btw this is my first python project, so sorry for the code quality.

Open Main.py to instantly clear you temp files. You can also lunch it from command line:

python Main.py [-console] [user]

The args in square brackets aren't mandatory and you also don't need to use both of them.
